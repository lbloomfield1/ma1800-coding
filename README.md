My project explored the idea of how technology has influence the interactions people have with one and other. The introduction of digital media systems which mimic the social interactions you can have with one and other has limited what people can do socially, and i wanted to bring this to life with my project. Things that have been limited are work interactions, you can have a meeting over the phone now and social interactions, speaking to your friends for example. 
The landing screen showcases the screen you get when you call someone into a phone call or in this case a facetime. i have chosen to add limited details apart from the buttons at this stage to show the disconnect with social interactions whilst still interacting with someone socially.  
 
One of the buttons shows social interactions. This is done through the Camera. Before the camera feature is introduced, essentially, you're just talking to your phone, which completely proves that the technical involvement is severing relationships. 
 
i wanted to show how important it is to create social memories with the camera button, however, now technology is always involved. Even the fact that i have that on a video showing of how the technological advancements have impacted social lives. I think this is for good, as i would not have been able to capture some of the memories i have without a phone. 
 
During this project, I found coding particularly difficult. I believe i had a strong idea and knew exactly how to execute it. I just found it difficult researching and problem solving by myself. i used resources including the ones below and the resources from both this module and the coding for the arts module. Notion included in below list.
